# React and Flux from Scratch - Fluent 2016

Please complete the following machine setup **in advance**:  
1. **Install the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org)**.  
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.  
3. **Download an editor that supports JSX and [install the appropriate plugin](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Complementary-Tools#jsx-integrations)**. I recommend SublimeText or Webstorm. Both offer free trials.  
4. **Clone the starter kit**. Open the command line and run this in the directory where you plan to work: 
```git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/react-flux-starter-kit.git```  
5. **Install the dependencies**. `cd react-flux-starter-kit` and then run this: `npm install` 
6. **Run the starter kit**. `npm start` This will start the app in your browser. If this works, you're all set!
